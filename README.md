The myEconomy Game

# Welcome to the myEconomy Project!
The myEconomy Project is a game that simulates a nation, with a great focus on its economy. Right now there are countless features, such as a complex tax system, a spending department, different GDP sectors, the ability to change your interest rate and detailed statistics, with much more features planned in the near future!

As the game is in the early stages of Early Access, it is not recommended that casual users play - you may see your save files get corrupted as more features are added to the game!

Save files are currently saved in the folder that the python file is located - as such, we suggest placing the python file inside its own folder.
