The myEconomy Game

# Sister Project
Checkout the [myEconomy's sister project](https://github.com/TheAnister/myEconomyGUI): a more less economic simulator with a graphical user interface

# Welcome to the myEconomy Project!
The myEconomy Project is a game that simulates a nation, with a great focus on its economy. Right now there are countless features, such as a complex tax system, a spending department, different GDP sectors, the ability to change your interest rate and detailed statistics, with much more features planned in the near future!

As the game is in the early stages of Early Access, it is not recommended that casual users play - you may see your save files get corrupted as more features are added to the game!

Save files are currently saved in the folder that the python file is located - as such, we suggest placing the python file inside its own folder.

# myEconomy vs myEconomyGUI
myEconomy is a more complex economic simulator compared to myEconomyGUI, such as having boom/bust cycles, different economic sectors, etc. However, it uses a command-line interface. To ensure that myEconomy is more up-to-date, we have created myEconomyGUI - a less complex version of myEconomy with the base features and a modern GUI with buttons, text fields and sliders.
